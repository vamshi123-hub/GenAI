       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video.

In-\\nspired by human attention mechanisms, these models learn\\ndynamic weights indicating the importance of different re-\\ngions in an image. However, the accuracy of the attention\\nthat is implicitly learned during training is not ensured. As\\nit can be observed in Fig.1, the model without attention su-\\npervision generates inaccurate attention maps, which results\\nin the incorrect answers. A new VQA-HAT (Human ATten-\\ntion) dataset has been recently collected by (Das et al. 2016)\\nand used to evaluate the attention learned in VQA attention-\\nbased models. The conclusion of this work was that current\\nattention-based models do not seem to focus on the same\\narea as humans do when answering the questions, which\\nsuggests that there is still room for improving the perfor-\\nmance of VQA by adding human attention supervision. The\\npublic VQA-HAT dataset has good potential to help train-\\ning. However, only around 10% of the human attention maps\\nCopyright c⃝2018, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial\\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

Best viewed in color.\\nfor the image-question pairs in the VQA v1.0 dataset (Antol\\net al. 2015) are labeled, which makes it less effective when\\nused for the purpose of evaluating and improving the quality\\nof the machine-generated attention maps as it is quite lim-\\nited. Besides, there are further questions to be explored:\\n• Do the regions highlighted by the human attention help\\nVQA attention-based models to yield better answers?\\n• How can human attention help to improve the perfor-\\nmance of attention-based models in VQA?\\nTo tackle these questions, a new and large-scale human at-\\ntention dataset is ﬁrst needed. Collecting human labeled at-\\ntention maps is one possible approach, but as mentioned in\\n(Das et al. 2016; Gan et al. 2017), it is a time-consuming and\\nexpensive task. Since attention-based models in VQA have\\nshown the good performance on VQA tasks, we therefore\\naim to develop a general network to automatically generate\\nattention maps for image-question pairs through training on\\nthe existing VQA-HAT. We propose a Human Attention Net-\\nwork (HAN) to generate attention maps for image-question\\narXiv:1709.06308v1  [cs.CV]  19 Sep 2017\\npairs. Speciﬁcally, we propose to use a Gated Recurrent Unit\\n(GRU) (Cho et al. 2014) to encode several attention maps\\nthat are learned in the attention-based model during train-\\ning in order to get a reﬁned attention map. The pre-trained\\nHAN is then used to generate attention maps for the image-\\nquestion pairs in the VQA v2.0 dataset. The new attention\\nmap dataset for the VQA v2.0 dataset is named as Human-\\nLike ATtention (HLAT) dataset.\\nThe human-like attention maps are then used as the atten-\\ntion supervision in the VQA attention-based model. In order\\nto better verify the effectiveness of the human-like attention\\nsupervision, we conduct two contrast experiments on the\\nVQA v2.0 dataset. To be speciﬁc, the attention-based model\\nproposed by (Kim et al. 2016b) is used as the baseline. We\\nthen add human-like attention supervision to the baseline\\nmodel. The experiment results show that the human-like at-\\ntention supervised model outperforms the baseline model by\\n0.15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of human-like atten-\\ntion supervision. As it can be seen in Fig.1, the model with\\nattention supervision generates more accurate attention and\\ngives the better answers. To summarize, the main contribu-\\ntions of our work are as follows:\\n1. A Human Attention Network (HAN) which can be con-\\nveniently used to produce human-like attention maps for\\nimage-question pairs is proposed.\\n2. The pre-trained HAN is used to produce human-like at-\\ntention maps for all the image-question pairs in the VQA\\nv2.0 dataset. We name the produced attention dataset for\\nthe VQA v2.0 dataset as Human-Like ATtention dataset\\n(HLAT). The HLAT can be used to explicitly train the\\nattention-based models and also evaluate the quality of the\\nmodel-generated attention. The dataset will be made avail-\\nable to the public.\\n3. The overall accuracy of the attention-based model im-\\nproves 0.15% on the VQA v2.0 test-dev set by adding\\nhuman-like attention supervision, showing the effectiveness\\nof explicit human-like attention supervision in VQA. There-\\nfore, we get to the conclusion that regions focused by hu-\\nmans indeed help VQA attention-based models to achieve a\\nbetter performance.\\nRelated Work\\nVQA attention-based model Traditional models (Antol et\\nal. 2015; Zhou et al. 2015; Noh, Hongsuck Seo, and Han\\n2016; Andreas et al. 2016; Malinowski, Rohrbach, and Fritz\\n2015) usually present general global features to represent\\nthe visual information, which may contain a lot of irrele-\\nvant and noisy information when predicting the answer. At-\\ntention mechanisms are therefore proposed to address this\\nproblem as they help models to focus only on the relevant\\nregion of the image according to the given question. (Yang\\net al. 2016) proposed stacked attention networks which em-\\nploy the attention networks for multi-step reasoning, nar-\\nrowing down the selection of visual information. Dynamic\\nmemory networks (Kumar et al. 2016) integrated an atten-\\ntion mechanism with a memory model. Multi-model com-\\npact bilinear pooling (Fukui et al. 2016) combined visual\\nand textual representations to a joint representation. Hier-\\narchical co-attention network (Lu et al. 2016) recursively\\nfused the attended question and image features to output the\\nanswers. Dual attention networks (Nam, Ha, and Kim 2016)\\nemployed multiple reasoning steps based on the memory of\\nprevious attention. (Kim et al. 2016b) proposed multimodal\\nlow-rank bilinear pooling (MLB) which uses element-wise\\nmultiplication to reduce complex computations of the origi-\\nnal bilinear pooling model.\\nOne limitation of the mentioned works is that they are\\nunsupervised attention models, whose attention is learned\\nwithout supervision. The attention in these models is al-\\nways learned implicitly and may end up being simply fortu-\\nitous, as it can be seen in Fig.1. To address this problem, we\\nexplore to add attention supervision to the attention-based\\nmodel. The attention maps in the HLAT are used as atten-\\ntion supervision to train the VQA model on the VQA v2.0\\ndataset.\\nAttention supervision Attention supervision has recently\\nbeen explored in computer vision. (Yu et al. 2017) lever-\\naged gaze tracking information to provide spatial and tem-\\nporal attention for video caption generation. In image cap-\\ntioning, (Liu et al. 2017) proposed a method to improve the\\ncorrectness of visual attention using object segments as su-\\npervision. (Gan et al. 2017) proposed to use segmentations\\nwhich are manually labeled by humans to supervise atten-\\ntion generated during training in VQA. However, using seg-\\nmentations as attention supervision is potentially inaccurate,\\nespecially for some questions that need more reasoning, for\\nexample, are all children paying attention to the class? Or Is\\nit a sunny day? It is ineffective to segment a speciﬁc object\\nto answer the questions. Apart from the accurate attention\\narea, the model also needs more global information to ana-\\nlyze. We propose to add human-like attention supervision to\\nmodels, as human-like attention contains lots of information\\nindicating the important areas that should be focused.\\nHuman attention dataset\\nResearch about human atten-\\ntion and eye tracking has already been carried out (Jiang\\net al. 2015; Das et al. 2016; Gan et al. 2017; Yu et al.\\n2017). (Jiang et al. 2015) used mouse-tracking to collect\\nlarge-scale human attention annotations for MS COCO. Re-\\ncently, (Das et al. 2016) published the VQA-HAT (Human\\nATtention) dataset which contains human attention annota-\\ntions for around 10% image-question pairs in the VQA v1.0\\ndataset. These datasets indicate the attentive area of the hu-\\nman when staring at the images and are very useful for eval-\\nuation purposes. However, as mentioned in (Das et al. 2016;\\nGan et al. 2017), collecting datasets is always a very time-\\nconsuming task and it requires a vast amount of effort. In\\nthis work, instead of collecting human labeled attention data,\\nthe HAN is proposed to generate attention maps automat-\\nically, training on the VQA-HAT dataset. The pre-trained\\nHAN can be generally used to produce attention maps for\\nimage-question pairs.\\nApproach\\nIn this section, details about this work will be provided.\\nFirst, the input representation will be introduced. Then, the\\ndetails of the Human Attention Network (HAN) and the su-\\npervised attention model for VQA will be presented. To help\\nunderstanding, they are illustrated in different sections.\\nCNN\\n(ResNet152)\\nWhat is he \\ndoing ?\\nMultimodal\\nlow-rank \\nbilinear \\npooling\\nConvolutional layer\\nGRU\\nGRU\\nGRU\\nGRU\\nFC layer\\n \\n \\n \\nGRU\\nReplicate\\nSoftmax layer\\nAttention generation\\nAttention refinement\\n2048×14×14\\n2048×14×14\\nPredicted attention map\\nAttention maps\\n \\nFigure 2: Human Attention Network (HAN) for predicting the attention map given an image-question pair.\\nInput representation\\nImage representation\\nFollowing the common practice in\\nthe art (Yang et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2016b), image features\\nare extracted from the ResNet-152 (He et al. 2016) which is\\npre-trained on the ImageNet (Deng et al. 2009). Speciﬁcally,\\nthe original image I is ﬁrst scaled to 448 × 448. Then, the\\nfeature from the last convolutional layer of the ResNet-152\\nis taken as the initial feature map. The image I is represented\\nas\\nF = CNN(I),\\n(1)\\nwhere F ∈Rm×l2 is a feature matrix, l2 = 14 × 14 is\\nthe number of regions in the image and m = 2048 is the\\ndimension of the feature vector for each region. Therefore,\\nthe input image I is represented by a set of visual feature\\nvectors over 14 × 14 regions of the image.\\nQuestion representation\\nFollowing (Kim et al. 2016b), a\\nGRU is employed to encode the question. Speciﬁcally, given\\na question q = {q1, ..., q|q|}, where qt is the one-hot encod-\\ning representation of the t-th word and |q| is the number of\\nwords in the question. First, the words are embedded to a\\nvector space by a word embedding matrix W which results\\nin xt = Wqt. The word embedding vectors are then sequen-\\ntially fed into a GRU module to get a sequence of hidden\\nstate vectors {h1, h2, ..., h|q|},\\nht = GRU(xt, ht−1), t ∈{1, 2, ..., |q|}.\\n(2)\\nFinally, the last hidden state vector h|q| of the GRU is taken\\nas the representation of the question, i.e., Q = h|q| ∈Rn,\\nwhere n is the size of the GRU. Note that the word embed-\\nding matrix and the GRU are trained end-to-end.\\nHuman Attention Network\\nGiven an image-question pair (I, q), our proposed Human\\nAttention Network (HAN) is designed to predict the atten-\\ntion map.\\nThe structure of the HAN is shown in Fig.2. It consists of\\ntwo modules, namely the attention generation module and\\nthe attention reﬁnement module. The attention generation\\nmodule is able to generate several coarse attention maps.\\nThe attention reﬁnement module aims to reﬁne the coarse\\nattention maps in order to obtain a more precise attention\\nmap.\\nAttention generation\\nThe attention mechanism used is\\nmotivated by (Kim et al. 2016b), which ﬁrst fuses the im-\\nage and the question by a low-rank bilinear pooling and\\nthen uses a convolutional layer to generate multiple attention\\nmaps over the image. Speciﬁcally, the feature matrix F of an\\nimage I and the feature vector Q of the question q are ﬁrst\\nprojected into a d-dimensional embedding space. Then, they\\nare fused by element-wise multiplication. The fused feature\\nmatrix of the image and the question is given by\\nX = σ(UQ · 1T ) ◦σ(V F),\\n(3)\\nwhere 1 ∈Rl2 denotes a column vector of ones, U ∈Rd×n\\nand V ∈Rd×m are respectively trainable afﬁne matrices\\nfor the question and for the image. The symbol ◦denotes\\nthe element-wise multiplication, while σ(·) is the hyperbolic\\ntangent function. Note that the bias terms in the low-rank\\nbilinear pooling are omitted for simplicity.\\nSubsequently, a convolutional layer is applied to the fused\\nfeature X to generate a sequence of attention maps which is\\nexpressed as\\nα1, α2, ..., αG = Ccon(X),\\n(4)\\nwhere Ccon(·) denotes the 1-D convolution operation with\\nG convolutional kernels of size 1. In this way, multiple at-\\ntention maps, also known as multiple glimpses in (Kim et al.\\n2016b; Fukui et al. 2016), are generated.\\nAttention reﬁnement\\nThe multiple attention maps gen-\\nerated by the attention generation module are coarse, how-\\never, they contain lots of information. In this section, the\\nmultiple attention maps are fused by means of a GRU, as it\\nhas the ability of neglecting irrelevant information and keep-\\ning the important information. Speciﬁcally, the sequence of\\nattention maps α = {α1, α2, ..., αG} that is generated by\\nthe attention generation module is fed into the GRU sequen-\\ntially. The last hidden state vector of the GRU is taken as\\nBicycle\\nHuman-like\\nattention\\nWhat is in front \\nof the bus?\\nModel-generated\\nattention\\nGRU\\nAttention \\nsupervision\\nCNN\\nAttention-based \\nmodel\\nFigure 3: Structure of the proposed supervised attention model.\\nThe model-generated attention explicitly learns from the human-\\nlike attention generated by the HAN.\\nthe attention vector hGRU(α) ∈Rp, where p is the size\\nof the GRU. The vector hGRU(α) is then driven through\\na fully connected layer followed by a softmax layer. More\\nformally, the predicted reﬁned attention map for the given\\nimage-question pair (I, q) is calculated as\\nα′\\nh(I, q) = softmax(W · hGRU(α) + b),\\n(5)\\nwhere W\\n∈Rl2×p is an afﬁne transformation matrix,\\nsoftmax(·) indicates the softmax function and b ∈Rl2 is\\nthe bias term.\\nObjective function\\nThe proposed HAN is trained on\\nthe VQA-HAT dataset, which contains triplets of (I, q, αh),\\nwhere αh is the human attention for the given image-\\nquestion pair (I, q).\\nIn order to make the model-generated attention map get\\nclose to the human attention map, the Mean Squared Error\\n(MSE) is used as the objective function. The MSE loss Lmse\\nfor a given training triplet is deﬁned as\\nLmse(I, q, ah; θ) = (α′\\nh(I, q) −αh)2,\\n(6)\\nwhere θ represents all trainable parameters used in the HAN.\\nThe HAN is trained by minimizing the overall MSE loss on\\na given training set D = {(I, q, αh)}.\\nargmin\\nθ\\nX\\n(I,q,ah)∈D\\nLmse(I, q, αh; θ).\\n(7)\\nAttention supervision for VQA\\nIn this section, the details of the VQA model are presented.\\nFor comparison, an unsupervised attention model is dis-\\ncussed ﬁrst. Afterwards, the proposed supervised attention\\nmodel is introduced.\\nUnsupervised attention model\\nThe Multimodal Low-\\nrank Bilinear attention networks (MLB) (Kim et al. 2016b)\\nis used as our baseline, due to its unsupervised attention\\nmechanism and satisfactory performance. Given an image-\\nquestion pair, the MLB ﬁrst generates several attention maps\\nfor the given image-question pair and obtains the attentive\\nvisual feature. Then, the attentive visual feature and the\\nquestion feature are fused by a low-rank bilinear pooling.\\nThe output is ﬁnally fed to a multi-way classiﬁer to produce\\nprobabilities over the candidate answers.\\nSpeciﬁcally, given an image feature matrix F and a ques-\\ntion feature vector Q, the attention maps are ﬁrst computed\\nas described in Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. Then, they are fed into a\\nsoftmax layer to get the probability distribution over the im-\\nage. Hence, a sequence of attention maps is obtained, de-\\nnoted as α = {α1, α2, ..., αG}. With the attention maps α,\\nthe s-dimensional attentive visual feature is then calculated\\nby\\nˆF =\\nGn\\ng=1\\nl2\\nX\\ni=1\\nsoftmax(αi\\ng)F i,\\n(8)\\nwhere f denotes the concatenation operation of vectors, αi\\ng\\nindicates the i-th element of the g-th attention maps in α,\\nF i indicates the i-th row of an image feature map and the\\ndimensionality of ˆF is s = m × G.\\nIn order to predict the answer, the attentive visual feature\\nvector ˆF and the question vector Q are combined through\\nanother low-rank bilinear pooling. The output of the low-\\nrank bilinear pooling is fed to a linear layer followed by a\\nsoftmax classiﬁer to produce probabilities over the candidate\\nanswers. More formally, the answer probabilities are given\\nby\\np(a | I, q; Θ) = softmax(P(σ(U ′Q) ◦σ(V ′ ˆF))),\\n(9)\\nwhere P ∈RK×r, U ′ ∈Rr×n and V ′ ∈Rr×s are trainable\\nafﬁne matrices. The MLB model is trained by minimizing\\nthe cross-entropy loss over the training data. Given a train-\\ning triplet of (I, q, A), where A is the ground truth of the\\npredicted answer, the cross-entropy loss is deﬁned as\\nLcls(I, q, A) = 1\\nK\\nK\\nX\\nk=1\\n−log p(ak | I, q ; Θ).\\n(10)\\nHere, Θ represents all parameters in the model and A ∈\\nAns, where Ans = {a1, a2, ..., aK} is the set of candidate\\nanswers, K is the size of the Ans. After training the model,\\nthe predicted answer of a given image-question pair (I, q) is\\nˆa = argmax p(a | I, q; Θ).\\n(11)\\nSupervised attention model\\nIn the mentioned MLB\\nmodel, attention maps are learned without any supervision,\\nwhich may lead to inaccurate attention maps, as shown in\\nFig.5. In order to remedy this problem, attention supervi-\\nsion is added to the unsupervised attention model. In this\\nway, the attention maps that are generated during training\\ncan explicitly learn from the ground truth.\\nSpeciﬁcally, to train the human-like attention supervised\\nmodel, the ground truth of the attention maps is needed.\\nHowever, the human-labeled attention maps in the VQA-\\nHAT dataset is not sufﬁcient and manually annotating a new\\nattention dataset is an expensive and time-consuming task.\\nTherefore, the pre-trained HAN is used to generate atten-\\ntion maps for all the image-question pairs in the VQA v2.0\\ndataset. The generated attention map dataset for the VQA\\nv2.0 dataset is named as Human-Like ATtention (HLAT)\\ndataset. Fig.4 shows the comparison between the human at-\\ntention and the human-like attention generated by the HAN.\\nAs it can be observed, the HAN-generated attention share\\nsimilar attentive areas with the human attention, showing\\nthe promising results of using human-like attention as the\\nground truth for the attention learned in the models. There-\\nfore, the HLAT is used for training the proposed supervised\\nattention model. Fig.3 shows the structure of the proposed\\nsupervised attention model.\\nMore formally, the triplet (I, q, A) in the VQA v2.0\\ndataset is extended to (I, q, A, α′\\nh), where α′\\nh is the gener-\\nated human-like attention map corresponding to the image-\\nquestion pair (I, q). In order to employ attention supervi-\\nsion, a GRU is ﬁrst employed to encode the sequence of at-\\ntention maps α = {α1, α2, ..., αG} that is generated in the\\nMLB to get a reﬁned attention map. The output is then fed to\\na linear layer followed by a softmax layer to produce atten-\\ntion probabilities over the image. The attention supervision\\nloss is computed by\\nLatt(I, q, α′\\nh) = (softmax(Wh · hGRU(α) + bh) −α′\\nh)2,\\n(12)\\nwhere Wh ∈Rl2×p is an afﬁne transformation matrix, bh ∈\\nRl2 is a bias term and p-dimensional hGRU(α) indicates the\\nlast hidden state vector of the GRU, which is conceptually\\nsimilar to the GRU deﬁned in Eq.5.\\nThe loss of the supervised attention model is the weighted\\nsum of the classiﬁcation loss and attention supervision loss.\\nGiven an extended training triplet of (I, q, A, α′\\nh), the loss\\nis deﬁned as\\nL(I, q, A, α′\\nh) = Lcls(I, q, A) + λ Latt(I, q, α′\\nh),\\n(13)\\nwhere λ is a trade-off parameter. The model is trained by\\nminimizing the total loss of Eq.13.\\nExperiment\\nHuman Attention Network (HAN)\\nDataset\\nThe HAN is evaluated on the recently released\\nVQA-HAT dataset (Das et al. 2016) as it is the only human-\\nlabeled attention dataset for VQA. The task of collecting\\nthe human attention data of the VQA-HAT dataset was im-\\nplemented by 800 different annotators. The dataset contains\\nhuman attention maps for around 60k image-question pairs\\nin the VQA v1.0 dataset, which in total has approximately\\n600k image-question pairs in the dataset. Speciﬁcally, the\\nannotators are shown a blurred image and a question about\\nthe image, and they need to sharpen the regions of the image\\nthat will help them to answer the question correctly. In the\\nend, human attention maps were collected for 58,475 image-\\nquestion pairs in the training set and 1,374 in the validation\\nset of the VQA v1.0. The HAN is trained on the training\\nset of the VQA-HAT and the experiment results are evalu-\\nated on the validation set of the VQA-HAT. Before training,\\n8 mislabeled attention maps whose value is zero were re-\\nmoved. As the output of the HAN is processed through a\\nsoftmax layer, all human attention maps are also fed to a\\nsoftmax layer before training for modeling consistency.\\nImplementation details\\nThe experimental setup of (Kim\\net al. 2016b) is also followed. The wording embedding ma-\\ntrix and the GRU for encoding words are initialized with the\\npre-trained skip-thought vector model (Kiros et al. 2015).\\nTable 1: Mean rank-correlation coefﬁcients A higher value\\nmeans a better quality. Error bars show standard error of the mean.\\nThe results show that attention maps produced by the HAN have\\nthe highest correlation with human attention maps, surpassing the\\nhuman performance by 0.045.\\nModel\\nMean Rank-correlation\\nRandom\\n0.000 ± 0.001\\nHuman\\n0.623 ± 0.003\\nSAN (Yang et al. 2016)\\n0.249 ± 0.004\\nHieCoAtt (Lu et al. 2016)\\n0.264 ± 0.004\\nHAN\\n0.668 ± 0.001\\nAs a result, the question vectors have 2400 dimensions. The\\nnumber of the glimpses in the HAN is set to 3, which shows\\nthe best performance. The size of the hidden state in the\\nGRU for reﬁning the attention maps is set to 512. The joint\\nembedding size d used for embedding images and questions\\nis set to 1200. The Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba 2014)\\nis used with a base learning rate of 3e-4. The batch size is\\nset to 64 and the iterations are set to 300k. Dropout is used\\nwith ratio 0.5. The network is implemented using the Torch7\\n(Collobert, Kavukcuoglu, and Farabet 2011).\\nEvaluation metric: rank correlation\\nThe evaluation\\nmethod provided in (Das et al. 2016) is used. This evaluation\\nmethod uses the mean rank-correlation coefﬁcient to evalu-\\nate the quality of the attention maps, a higher value mean-\\ning a better quality. To be speciﬁc, ﬁrst, both the machine-\\ngenerated attention maps and the human labeled attention\\nmaps scaled to 14 × 14. Then, the pixels are ranked accord-\\ning to their spatial attention value and ﬁnally, the correla-\\ntion between the two ranked lists is computed. In (Das et\\nal. 2016), in order to make the results more objective, three\\nhuman attention maps are collected per image-question pair\\nfor the validation dataset and the mean rank-correlation is\\ncomputed among these three maps. Therefore, in this exper-\\niment, the reported correlation value is averaged over the\\nthree sets of attention maps that are labeled by different an-\\nnotators. The rank-correlation in the experiment is calcu-\\nlated by\\n1\\n3\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n(1 −\\n6 Pl2\\nj=1(att′j −attj\\ni)2\\nl2 −l\\n)\\n(14)\\nwhere att′j is the j-th element of the predicted attention map\\nand attj\\ni is the j-th element of the human attention map la-\\nbeled by i-th annotator. l denotes the size of the attention\\nmap, which is 14 in this experiment.\\nResults\\nPrevious works (Kim et al. 2016b; Fukui et al.\\n2016) have explored the effect of the different number of\\nglimpses in VQA. It was found that multiple glimpses may\\nresult in a better performance. Therefore, the HAN is also\\nevaluated with different glimpses, namely 1, 2, 3 and 4,\\nyielding a performance of 0.536, 0.656, 0.668 and 0.553 re-\\nspectively. The number of glimpses is set to 3 in the experi-\\nment, as the model shows the best performance.

The correlation between human-labeled attention maps\\nis 0.623, which shows that different annotators have differ-\\nent views about the relevant area in the image given the\\nsame question and the correctness of the attention maps is\\ndifﬁcult to deﬁne. Therefore, for this model, making model-\\ngenerated attention more human-like is the best choice. The\\nexperiment also shows that our generated attention has the\\nhighest correlation (0.668) with human attention, showing\\nthe ability of the HAN to generate human-like attention\\nmaps for image-question pairs.\\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of using the GRU to\\nfuse attention maps, two experiments are conducted with the\\nnumber of glimpses equal to 2 and 3. Speciﬁcally, in these\\ntwo experiments, instead of fusing the attention maps using\\nthe GRU, the average attention map is obtained among sev-\\neral attention maps. The performance of our model with and\\nwithout GRU is shown in Tab.2. The HAN using the GRU\\nsigniﬁcantly outperforms the HAN without using the GRU,\\nshowing the effectiveness of using the GRU to encode the\\nattention maps.\\nAttention-based model for VQA\\nDataset\\nThe unsupervised attention model and the super-\\nvised attention model are evaluated on the more recent VQA\\nv2.0 dataset, which contains 443,757 image-question pairs\\nin the training set, 214,354 in the validation set and 447,793\\nin the testing set. This version of the dataset is more balanced\\nin comparison to the VQA v1.0 dataset. Speciﬁcally, for ev-\\nery question, there are two similar images but they yield two\\ndifferent answers. Therefore, it forces models to focus more\\non visual information. The models are trained on the training\\nand validation sets and tested on the test-dev set.\\nWhen training the supervised attention model, the atten-\\ntion maps in the generated HLAT dataset are used as the\\nground truth of the attention maps.

As shown in this\\ntable, our supervised model outperforms the unsupervised\\nmodel by 0.11% when the number of glimpses is set to 1\\nand by 0.15% when the number of glimpses is set to 2,\\nshowing the effectiveness of applying attention supervision\\nto attention-based model. The supervised model achieves a\\nmuch higher accuracy when the question is a counting prob-\\nlem, which indicates that the generated attention in the su-\\npervised model is more accurate and comprehensive. Fig.5\\nsamples the attention maps and the answers that are pre-\\ndicted by both the unsupervised model and the supervised\\nmodel. As it can be observed, after human-like attention su-\\npervision, the attention maps are more accurate and focused\\non the most relevant areas. It can therefore be concluded that\\nmore human-like attention helps to improve the performance\\nof the model.\\nConclusion\\nIn this work, we make a ﬁrst attempt to verify the effec-\\ntiveness of applying human-like attention supervision in\\nVQA. The HAN is ﬁrst proposed to generate human-like at-\\ntention maps for image-question pairs. The HLAT dataset\\ngenerated by the HAN can be potentially used as a su-\\npervision to help training attention-based models in VQA.\\nThe framework of the human-like attention supervision in\\nthe proposed supervised attention model can be easily ap-\\nplied to other attention-based models. The experiment re-\\nsults demonstrate that the supervised model outperforms\\nthe unsupervised model and through visualization, it is ob-\\nserved that the attention that is generated by the supervised\\nattention model is more accurate, which yields better an-\\nswers. In conclusion, explicit attention supervision indeed\\nhelp attention-based models in VQA to get a better perfor-\\nmance.\\nReferences\\n[Andreas et al. 2016] Andreas, J.; Rohrbach, M.; Darrell, T.;\\nand Klein, D. 2016.

(a) In Softmax\\nattention, each query aggregates information from all features, incurring quadratic\\ncomplexity. (b) Leveraging the redundancy between attention weights, agent attention\\nuses a small number of agent tokens to act as the “agent” for queries, capturing diverse\\nsemantic information from all features, and then presenting it to each query. The\\nattention weights are derived from DeiT-T and Agent-DeiT-T.\\nNevertheless, incorporating Transformers and self-attention into the visual\\ndomain presents formidable challenges. Modern Transformer models commonly\\nemploy Softmax attention [45], which computes the similarity between each\\nquery-key pair, resulting in quadratic computation complexity with respect to\\nthe number of tokens. As a result, directly applying Softmax attention with\\nglobal receptive fields to the visual tasks can lead to unmanageable compu-\\ntational demands. To tackle this issue, existing works [16, 17, 19, 29, 46, 50, 63]\\nattempt to reduce computation complexity by designing efficient attention pat-\\nterns. As two representatives, Swin Transformer [29] reduces the receptive field\\nand confines self-attention calculations to local windows. PVT [46] employs a\\nsparse attention pattern to alleviate the computational burden by reducing the\\nnumber of keys and values. Despite their effectiveness, these methods inevitably\\ncompromise the capability to model long-range relationships, and are still infe-\\nrior to global self-attention mechanism.\\nIn this paper, in contrast to restricting receptive field or introducing sparsity,\\nwe propose a novel quadruplet attention paradigm (Q, A, K, V ), dubbed Agent\\nAttention, which exploits redundancy between attention weights to achieve\\nboth high model expressiveness and low computation complexity. As shown in\\nFig. 1, in Softmax attention, each query aggregates information from all features,\\nincurring quadratic complexity. In fact, many queries, such as those denoting sky\\nin Fig. 1a, require similar information. Therefore, our motivation is to eliminate\\nthe direct contact between each query and key, and instead use a small number\\nof agent tokens A to act as the “agent” for queries, capturing diverse semantic\\ninformation from all features, and then presenting it to each query. As illus-\\ntrated in Fig. 1b and Fig. 2c, the resulting agent attention is composed of two\\nconventional Softmax attention operations. The first Softmax attention treats\\nagent tokens A as queries to aggregate agent features VA from all values V , and\\nthe second utilizes agent tokens A as keys, broadcasting the global information\\nAgent Attention\\n3\\nMatmul\\nSoftmax\\nMatmul\\n\\x01 × \\x03\\n\\x01 × \\x03\\n\\x04\\x05  \\x01 × \\x06\\n\\x07\\nMatmul\\nSoftmax\\n\\x03 × \\x01\\n\\x03 × \\x01\\n\\x07\\nMatmul\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x08\\t\\n\\x08\\n\\x05\\n\\x01 × \\x06\\n\\x04\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x0b\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x0c\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n(c) Agent Attention \\r(\\x0f\\x10\\x11)\\n(as key)\\n(as query)\\n(as value)\\nMatmul\\nSoftmax\\n\\x03 × \\x03\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\nMatmul\\n\\x03 × \\x03\\n\\x0c\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x04\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x0b\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x07\\n(a) Softmax Attention \\r(\\x0f\\x13\\x11)\\nMatmul\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\nMatmul\\n\\x06 × \\x03\\n\\x06 × \\x06\\n \\x08\\n \\x08\\n\\x0b\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x04\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x0c\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x03 × \\x06\\n\\x07\\n(b) Linear Attention \\r(\\x0f\\x11\\x13)\\nFig. 2: Difference between Softmax attention, Linear attention and Agent\\nattention.

Intuitively,\\nthe newly introduced tokens A serve as “agent” for the query tokens Q, as they\\ndirectly collect information from K and V , and then deliver the result to Q.\\nDue to the intrinsic redundancy in global self-attention, the number of agent\\ntokens can be designed to be much smaller than the number of query tokens. This\\nproperty endows agent attention with high efficiency, reducing the quadratic\\ncomplexity of Softmax attention to linear complexity while preserving global\\ncontext modelling capability. Interestingly, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the proposed\\nagent attention practically forms an elegant integration of Softmax and linear\\nattention, which explains how it achieves both high efficiency and high expres-\\nsiveness from a novel perspective.\\nWe empirically verify the effectiveness of our model across diverse vision\\ntasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation\\nand image generation. Our method yields substantial improvements in various\\ntasks, particularly in high-resolution scenarios. Noteworthy, our agent attention\\ncan be directly plugged into pre-trained large diffusion models, and without\\nany additional training, it not only accelerates the generation process, but also\\nnotably improves the generation quality.\\n2\\nRelated Works\\nVision Transformer. Since the inception of Vision Transformer [13], self-\\nattention has made notable strides in the realm of computer vision. However, the\\nquadratic complexity of the prevalent Softmax attention [45] poses a challenge in\\napplying self-attention to visual tasks. Previous works proposed various remedies\\n4\\nHan et al.\\nfor this computational challenge. PVT [46] introduces sparse global attention,\\ncurbing computation cost by reducing the resolution of K and V . Swin Trans-\\nformer [29] restricts self-attention computations to local windows and employs\\nshifted windows to model the entire image. NAT [19] emulates convolutional\\noperations and calculates attention within the neighborhood of each feature.\\nDAT [50] designs a deformable attention module to achieve a data-dependent\\nattention pattern. BiFormer [63] uses bi-level routing attention to dynamically\\ndetermine areas of interest for each query. GRL [25] employs a mixture of an-\\nchored stripe attention, window attention, and channel attention to achieve ef-\\nficient image restoration. However, these approaches inherently limit the global\\nreceptive field of self-attention or are vulnerable to specifically designed attention\\npatterns, hindering their plug-and-play adaptability for general purposes.\\nLinear Attention. In contrast to the idea of restricting receptive fields, linear\\nattention directly addresses the computational challenge by reducing compu-\\ntation complexity. The pioneer work [22] discards the Softmax function and\\nreplaces it with a mapping function ϕ applied to Q and K, thereby reduc-\\ning the computation complexity to O(N). However, such approximations led\\nto substantial performance degradation. To tackle this problem, Efficient Atten-\\ntion [41] applies the Softmax function to both Q and K. SOFT [32] and Nys-\\ntrömformer [53] employ matrix decomposition to further approximate Softmax\\noperation. Castling-ViT [57] uses Softmax attention as an auxiliary training tool\\nand fully employs linear attention during inference. FLatten Transformer [14]\\nproposes focused function and adopts depthwise convolution to preserve feature\\ndiversity. While these methods are effective, they continue to struggle with the\\nlimited expressive power of linear attention. In the paper, rather than enhancing\\nSoftmax or linear attention, we propose agent attention which integrates these\\ntwo attention types, achieving superior performance in various tasks.\\n3\\nPreliminaries\\nIn this section, we first review the general form of self-attention in vision Trans-\\nformers and briefly analyze the pros and cons of Softmax and linear attention.\\n3.1\\nGeneral Form of Self-Attention\\nWith an input of N tokens represented as x ∈RN×C, self-attention can be\\nformulated as follows in each head:\\n  \\\\lab e l  {eq : g ene r\\nal _\\na\\nt\\ntn}\\n \\\\begin  {s\\npl\\nit}  Q=xW_Q , K\\n=xW_K, V=xW_V, \\\\ \\\\\\rO_i=\\\\sum _{j=1}^{N}\\\\ \\\\frac {{\\\\rm Sim}{\\\\left (Q_i,K_j\\\\right )}}{\\\\sum _{j=1}^{N}\\\\ {\\\\rm Sim}{\\\\left (Q_i,K_j\\\\right )}}V_j, \\\\end {split} \\n(1)\\nwhere WQ/K/V ∈RC×d are projection matrices, C and d are the channel dimen-\\nsion of module and each head, and Sim(·, ·) denotes the similarity function.\\nAgent Attention\\n5\\nGeneralized Linear Attention\\n·\\n·\\n·\\n·\\nEquals\\n\\x02\\n\\x03 × \\x05\\n\\x06\\x07 \\x08  \\t\\n\\n × \\x03\\n\\x06\\x0b \\x0c\\n\\x03 × \\n\\x0c\\n\\x03 × \\x05\\n\\r\\t\\n\\x05 × \\n\\r\\n\\n × \\x05\\n\\x08\\t\\n\\x05 × \\x03\\n\\x02\\n\\x03 × \\x05\\n⭐Step1  Agent Aggregation\\n⭐Step2  Agent Broadcast\\n\\x0e\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                  \\n\\x0e\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                             \\n\\x0c\\n\\x08\\n\\x02\\nSoftmax Attention\\nSoftmax Attention\\n\\x10\\x11\\n\\x10\\x12\\n\\x10\\x13\\nPooling\\n           \\x14\\n(as query)\\n\\x15\\n\\x16\\n\\x17\\n\\x14\\n(as key)\\n\\x16\\x18\\n(as value)\\nAgent Tokens\\nAgent \\nFeatures\\nAgent Bias\\nFeature Flow\\nAgent Flow\\nDWC\\n(b) Agent Attention Module\\n(a) Agent Attention\\nFig. 3:\\nAn illustration of our agent attention and agent attention module.\\n(a) Agent attention uses agent tokens to aggregate global information and distribute\\nit to individual image tokens, resulting in a practical integration of Softmax and linear\\nattention. σ(·) represents Softmax function. In (b), we depict the information flow\\nof agent attention module. As a showcase, we acquire agent tokens through pooling.\\nSubsequently, agent tokens are utilized to aggregate information from V , and Q queries\\nfeatures from the agent features. In addition, agent bias and DWC are adopted to add\\npositional information and maintain feature diversity.\\n3.2\\nSoftmax Attention and Linear Attention\\nWhen using Sim (Q, K) = exp(QKT /\\n√\\nd) in Eq. (1), it becomes Softmax at-\\ntention [45], which has been highly successful in modern vision Transformer\\ndesigns. However, Softmax attention compels to compute the similarity between\\nall query-key pairs, resulting in O(N 2) complexity. Consequently, using Soft-\\nmax attention with a global receptive field leads to overwhelming computation\\ncomplexity. To tackle this problem, previous works attempted to reduce the num-\\nber of tokens N by designing sparse global attention [46, 47] or window atten-\\ntion [12,29] patterns. While effective, these strategies unavoidably compromise\\nthe self-attention’s capability for long-range modeling.\\nComparably, linear attention [22] efficiently addresses the computation chal-\\nlenge with a linear complexity of O(N). Specifically, carefully designed mapping\\nfunctions are applied to Q and K respectively, i.e., Sim (Q, K) = ϕ(Q)ϕ(K)T .\\nThis gives us the opportunity to change the computation order from (ϕ(Q)ϕ(K)T )V\\nto ϕ(Q)(ϕ(K)T V ) based on the associative property of matrix multiplication. As\\nillustrated in Fig. 2, by doing so, the computation complexity with respect to\\ntoken number is reduced to O(N). However, designing effective mapping func-\\ntion ϕ(·) proves to be a nontrivial task. Simple functions [41] such as ReLU lead\\nto significant performance drop, whereas more intricate designs [7] or matrix\\ndecomposition methods [32, 53] may introduce extra computation overhead. In\\ngeneral, current linear attention approaches are still inferior to Softmax atten-\\ntion, limiting their practical application.\\n4\\nAgent Transformer\\nAs discussed in Sec. 3, Softmax and linear attention suffer from either excessive\\ncomputation complexity or insufficient model expressiveness. Previous research\\n6\\nHan et al.\\ncommonly treated these two attention paradigms as distinct approaches and at-\\ntempted to either reduce the computation cost of Softmax attention or enhance\\nthe performance of linear attention. In this section, we propose a new atten-\\ntion paradigm named Agent Attention, which practically forms an elegant\\nintegration of Softmax and linear attention, enjoying benefits from both linear\\ncomplexity and high expressiveness.\\n4.1\\nAgent Attention\\nTo simplify, we abbreviate Softmax and linear attention as:\\n  \\\\begin  { s plit} O^ {\\\\ r m S} \\\\!=\\\\!{\\\\rm \\\\ s igma }(Q K^ T )V \\\\triangleq {\\\\rm Attn}^{\\\\rm S}(Q,K,V), \\\\\\rO^{\\\\rm \\\\phi }\\\\!=\\\\!\\\\phi (Q)\\\\phi (K)^TV \\\\triangleq {\\\\rm Attn}^{\\\\rm \\\\phi }(Q,K,V), \\\\end {split} (2)\\nwhere Q, K, V ∈RN×C denote query, key and value matrices and σ(·) represents\\nSoftmax function. Then our agent attention can be written as:\\n  \\\\ label {e q: agnet_us e_ t w\\no\\n_s\\no\\nftmax } \\\\begin {s\\np\\nl\\nit\\n}\\n O^{\\\\ rm A}=&\\\\ \\\\underbrace {{\\\\rm Attn}^{\\\\rm S}(Q,A,\\\\underbrace {{\\\\rm Attn}^{\\\\rm S}(A,K,V)}_{\\\\rm Agent\\\\ Aggregation})}_{\\\\rm Agent\\\\ Broadcast}. \\\\\\\\ \\\\end {split} t\\n(3)\\nIt is equivalent to:\\n  \\\\ label  {eq:a g e n t_is_linear }  \\n\\\\begin {spl it }  \\nO\\n^{\\n\\\\\\nrm A}=\\\\ {\\\\r m \\\\sig ma }\\n(QA^T)\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(AK^T)\\\\ V =\\\\ {\\\\phi }_q(Q){\\\\phi }_k(K)^TV =\\\\ \\\\underbrace {{\\\\rm Attn}^{\\\\rm \\\\phi _{q/k}}(Q,K,V)}_{\\\\rm Generalized\\\\ Linear\\\\ Attn}, \\\\\\\\ \\\\end {split} \\n(4)\\nwhere A ∈Rn×C is our newly defined agent tokens.\\nAs shown in Eq. (3) and Fig. 3a, our agent attention consists of two Softmax\\nattention operations, namely agent aggregation and agent broadcast. Specifically,\\nwe initially treat agent tokens A as queries and perform attention calculations\\nbetween A, K, and V to aggregate agent features VA from all values. Subse-\\nquently, we utilize A as keys and VA as values in the second attention calcula-\\ntion with the query matrix Q, broadcasting the global information from agent\\nfeatures to every query token and obtaining the final output O. In this way, we\\navoid the computation of pairwise similarities between Q and K while preserving\\ninformation exchange between each query-key pair through agent tokens.\\nThe newly defined agent tokens A essentially serve as the agent for Q, ag-\\ngregating global information from K and V , and subsequently broadcasting it\\nback to Q. Practically, we set the number of agent tokens n as a small hyper-\\nparameter, achieving a linear complexity of O(Nnd) relative to the number of\\ninput features N while maintaining global context modeling capability. Inter-\\nestingly, as shown in Eq. (4) and Fig. 3a, we practically integrate the powerful\\nSoftmax attention and efficient linear attention, establishing a generalized lin-\\near attention paradigm by employing two Softmax attention operations, with the\\nequivalent mapping function defined as ϕq(Q) = σ(QAT ), ϕk(K) =\\n\\x00σ(AKT )\\n\\x01T .\\nIn practice, agent tokens can be acquired through different methods, such as\\nsimply setting as a set of learnable parameters or extracting from input features\\nAgent Attention\\n7\\nthrough pooling or convolution. It is worth noticing that more advanced tech-\\nniques like deformed points [50] or token merging [1] can also be used to obtain\\nagent tokens. In the default setting, we employ the simple pooling strategy to\\nobtain agent tokens, which already works surprisingly well.\\n4.2\\nAgent Attention Module\\nAgent attention inherits the merits of both Softmax and linear attention. In\\npractical use, we further make two improvements to maximize its potential.\\nAgent Bias. In order to better utilize positional information, we present a\\ncarefully designed Agent Bias for our agent attention. Specifically, inspired by\\nRPB [40], we introduce agent bias within the attention calculation, i.e.,\\n  \\\\ label {eq :agnet_bi as} \\\\begin {split} O^{\\\\rm A}\\\\!=\\\\ &{\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(QA^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_2)\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(AK^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_1)\\\\ V, \\\\\\\\ \\\\end {split} \\n(5)\\nwhere B1 ∈Rn×N, B2 ∈RN×n are our agent biases. For parameter efficiency,\\nwe construct each agent bias using three bias components rather than directly\\nsetting B1, B2 as learnable parameters (see Appendix). Agent bias augments the\\nvanilla agent attention with spatial information, helping different agent tokens\\nto focus on diverse regions. As shown in Tab. 6, significant improvements can be\\nobserved upon the introduction of our agent bias terms.\\nDiversity Restoration Module. Although agent attention benefits from both\\nlow computation cost and high expressiveness, as generalized linear attention, it\\nalso suffers from insufficient feature diversity [14]. As a remedy, we follow [14]\\nand adopt a depthwise convolution (DWC) module to preserve feature diversity.\\nAgent Attention Module. Building upon these designs, we propose a novel\\nattention module named Agent Attention Module. As illustrated in Fig. 3(b),\\nour module is composed of three parts, namely pure agent attention, agent bias\\nand the DWC module. Our module can be formulated as:\\n  \\\\label {e q:agent_a t t n_mod ule1} \\\\begin {split} O=&\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(QA^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_2)\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(AK^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_1)\\\\ V+{\\\\rm DWC}(V), \\\\end {split} \\n(6)\\nwhere Q, K, V ∈RN×C, A ∈Rn×C, B1 ∈Rn×N and B2 ∈RN×n. In the default\\nsetting, agent tokens A is obtained through pooling, i.e., A = Pooling(Q). The\\noverall module complexity is expressed as:\\n  \\\\lab\\ne l {\\neq:c\\no mp\\nlexi\\nty}  \\\\begi\\nn  {sp l it} \\n\\\\\\nOm\\ne\\nga =& \\\\ \\\\underb\\nr ace \\n{ 4N C\\n^2}\\n_{\\\\rm Proj}\\\\ +\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\underbrace {NC}_{\\\\rm Get\\\\ Agents}\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\ \\\\underbrace {2nNC+2NnC}_{\\\\rm Agent\\\\ Attention}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\underbrace {k^2NC}_{\\\\rm DWC}, \\\\end {split} \\n(7)\\nwhere N, n are the number of input features and agent tokens, and k = 3 is the\\nkernel size of DWC. Notably, our model exhibits linear complexity for N.\\nCombining the merits of Softmax and linear attention, our module offers the\\nfollowing advantages:\\n(1) Efficient computation and high expressive capability. Previous\\nwork usually viewed Softmax attention and linear attention as two different\\nattention paradigms, aiming to address their respective limitations.

Our module can adopt a large receptive field\\nwhile maintaining the same amount of computation. Modern vision Transformer\\nmodels typically resort to sparse attention [46, 47] or window attention [12, 29]\\nto mitigate the computation burden of Softmax attention.

See Appendix for training settings.\\nResults. As depicted in Tab. 1, substituting Softmax attention with agent at-\\ntention in various models results in significant performance improvements.

We apply our model to RetinaNet [26], Mask\\nR-CNN [20] and Cascade Mask R-CNN [4] frameworks to evaluate the perfor-\\nmance of our method. A series of experiments are conducted utilizing both 1x\\nand 3x schedules with different detection heads. As depicted in Tab. 2, our model\\nexhibits consistent enhancements across all configurations. Agent-PVT outper-\\nforms PVT models with an increase in box AP ranging from +3.9 to +4.7,\\nwhile Agent-Swin surpasses Swin models by up to +1.5 box AP. These substan-\\ntial improvements can be attributed to the large receptive field brought by our\\ndesign, proving the effectiveness of agent attention in high-resolution scenarios.\\n5.3\\nSemantic Segmentation\\nADE20K [62] is a well-established benchmark for semantic segmentation which\\nencompasses 20K training images and 2K validation images. We apply our model\\nto two exemplary segmentation models, namely SemanticFPN [23] and Uper-\\nNet [51]. The results are presented in Tab. 3. Remarkably, our Agent-PVT-T\\nand Agent-Swin-T achieve +3.61 and +2.17 higher mIoU than their counter-\\nparts. The results show that our model is compatible with various segmentation\\nbackbones and consistently achieves improvements.\\n5.4\\nAgent Attention for Stable Diffusion\\nThe advent of diffusion models makes it possible to generate high-resolution and\\nhigh-quality images. However, current diffusion models mainly use the original\\nSoftmax attention with a global receptive field, resulting in huge computation\\ncost and slow generation speed. In the light of this, we apply our agent attention\\nto Stable Diffusion [37], hoping to improve the generation speed of the model.\\nSurprisingly, after simple adjustments, the Stable Diffusion model using agent\\nAgent Attention\\n11\\n1.50\\n1.75\\n2.00\\n2.25\\n2.50\\ns/img\\n28\\n29\\nFID\\nSD\\nToMeSD\\nAgentSD\\n1.69x \\n0.2\\n1.84x \\n0.4\\n0.9\\n(a) Quantitative results\\nSD\\nToMeSD\\nAgentSD\\n(Ours)\\ncls\\n“ goldfinch, \\nCarduelis carduelis ”\\n“ desk ”\\n“ mitten ”\\n“ bell pepper ”\\n(b) Samples\\nFig. 6: (a) Quantitative Results of Stable Diffusion (SD), ToMeSD and our AgentSD.\\nFor ToMeSD, we take the merging ratios {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5} to construct five differ-\\nent models. Furthermore, we apply agent attention to each ToMeSD model to obtain\\nthe corresponding AgentSD model. (b) Samples generated by SD, ToMeSD (r = 40%)\\nand AgentSD (r = 40%).

We practically apply agent\\nattention to ToMeSD model [3]. ToMeSD reduces the number of tokens before\\nattention calculation in Stable Diffusion, enhancing generation speed. Nonethe-\\nless, the post-merge token count remains considerable, resulting in continued\\ncomplexity and latency. Hence, we replace the Softmax attention employed in\\nToMeSD model with our agent attention to further enhance speed. We experi-\\nmentally find that when producing agent tokens through token merging [1], our\\nagent attention can be directly applied to Stable Diffusion and ToMeSD model\\nwithout any extra training. However, we are unable to apply the agent bias and\\nDWC in this way. As a remedy, we make two simple adjustments to the agent\\nattention, which are described in detail in Appendix. In addition, we get a signif-\\nicant boost by applying agent attention during early diffusion generation steps\\nand keeping the later steps unchanged.\\nQuantitative Results. We follow [3] and quantitatively compare AgentSD with\\nStable Diffusion and ToMeSD. As displayed in Fig. 6a, ToMeSD accelerates Sta-\\nble Diffusion while maintaining similar image quality. AgentSD not only fur-\\nther accelerates ToMeSD but also significantly enhances image generation qual-\\nity. Specifically, while maintaining superior image generation quality, AgentSD\\nachieves 1.84x and 1.69x faster generation speeds compared to Stable Diffusion\\nand ToMeSD, respectively. At an equivalent generation speed, AgentSD produces\\nsamples with a 0.9 lower FID score compared to ToMeSD. See the experimental\\ndetails and full comparison table in Appendix.\\nVisualization. We present some visualizations in Fig. 6b. AgentSD noticeably\\nreduces ambiguity and generation errors in comparison to Stable Diffusion and\\nToMeSD. For instance, in the first column, Stable Diffusion and ToMeSD pro-\\nduce birds with one leg and two tails, while AgentSD’s sample does not exhibit\\n12\\nHan et al.\\nTable 4: Ablation on window size based on Agent-Swin-T.\\nWindow\\nFLOPs\\n#Param\\nAcc.\\nDiff.\\nAgent-Swin-T\\n72\\n4.5G\\n29M\\n82.0\\n-0.6\\n142\\n4.5G\\n29M\\n82.2\\n-0.4\\n282\\n4.5G\\n29M\\n82.4\\n-0.2\\n562\\n4.5G\\n29M\\n82.6\\nOurs\\nSwin-T\\n72\\n4.5G\\n29M\\n81.3\\n-1.3\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n         \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n            \\n      \\n      \\n            \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n         \\n      \\n            \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n          \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n         \\n      \\n            \\n    \\n    \\n(a) \\n(b) \\n(c) \\nFig. 7: (a) Comparison of FLOPs between Swin and our Agent-Swin as window size\\nincreases.

Refer to Appendix for details.\\n5.5\\nLarge Receptive Field and High Resolution\\nLarge Receptive Field. Modern vision Transformers often confine self-attention\\ncalculation to local windows to reduce computation complexity, such as Swin [29].\\nIn Tab. 4, we gradually enlarge the window size of Agent-Swin-T, ranging from\\n72 to 562. Clearly, as the receptive field expands, the model’s performance con-\\nsistently improves. This indicates that while the window attention pattern is\\neffective, it inevitably compromises the long-range modeling capability of self-\\nattention and remains inferior to global attention. As shown in Fig. 7a, unlike\\nthe quadratic complexity of Softmax attention, the linear complexity of agent\\nattention enables us to benefit from a global receptive field while preserving\\nidentical computation complexity.\\nHigh Resolution. Limited by the quadratic complexity of Softmax attention,\\ncurrent vision Transformer models usually scale up by increasing model depth\\nand width. Building on insights from [43], we discover that enhancing resolution\\nmight be a more effective approach for scaling vision Transformers, particularly\\nAgent Attention\\n13\\nTable 5: Scaling up by increasing resolution.

We observed analogous trends when scaling the resolution of Agent-\\nPVT-M and Agent-Swin-S (see Appendix). Fig. 7b shows the FLOPs comparison\\nbetween Agent-DeiT and DeiT, with Agent-DeiT saving 75% of FLOPs for 10242\\nresolution images. In Fig. 7c, we progressively increase the resolution of Agent-\\nSwin-S, Swin-S, and Swin-B. It is evident that in high-resolution scenarios, our\\nmodel consistently delivers notably superior outcomes.\\n5.6\\nAblation Study\\nIn this section, we ablate the key components in our agent attention module to\\nverify the effectiveness of these designs. We report the results on ImageNet-1K\\nclassification based on Agent-Swin-T.\\nAblation on key designs. We substitute Softmax attention in Swin-T with\\nvanilla linear attention, followed by a gradual introduction of agent attention,\\nagent bias, and DWC to create Agent-Swin-T. The results are depicted in Tab. 6.\\nThree key findings emerge: (1) Agent attention boosts accuracy by 1.2, proving\\nits effectiveness. (2) Agent bias serves as an effective position embedding for\\nagent attention, similar to RPE in Swin. (3) DWC is a crucial complement\\nto unlock the capabilities of agent attention. When applying DWC to Swin-T,\\na modest gain of 0.3 is observed. In contrast, with DWC preserving feature\\ndiversity, agent attention delivers a much better result (+1.5).\\nAblation on number of agent tokens.

This aligns with the stripe width design principle in CSwin [12].\\nComparison with Other Linear Attention. We conduct a comparison of our\\nagent attention with other linear attention methods using DeiT-T and Swin-T.\\nAs depicted in Tab. 8, substituting the Softmax attention employed by DeiT-\\nT and Swin-T with various linear attention methods usually results in notable\\nperformance degradation. Remarkably, our models outperform all other methods\\nas well as the Softmax baseline.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nThis paper presents a new attention paradigm dubbed Agent Attention, which is\\napplicable across a variety of vision Transformer models. As an elegant integra-\\ntion of Softmax and linear attention, agent attention enjoys both high expressive\\npower and low computation complexity. Extensive experiments on image classi-\\nfication, semantic segmentation, and object detection unequivocally confirm the\\neffectiveness of our approach, particularly in high-resolution scenarios. When in-\\ntegrated with Stable Diffusion, agent attention accelerates image generation and\\nsubstantially enhances image quality without any extra training. Due to its linear\\ncomplexity with respect to the number of tokens and its strong representation\\npower, agent attention may pave the way for challenging tasks with super long\\ntoken sequences, such as video modelling and multi-modal foundation models.\\nAgent Attention\\n15\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis work is supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China\\nunder Grant 2021ZD0140407, the National Natural Science Foundation of China\\nunder Grants 42327901 and 62321005.\\nReferences\\n1.

Comparision with Related Works\\nAgent attention shares some similarities with two related works, namely GPViT [55]\\nand GRL [25]. In this section, we provide a detailed analysis on their fundamental\\ndistinctions and the superiority of our work.\\nFirstly, agent attention’s design is novel and superior. Agent attention in-\\ntroduces a set of agent tokens A to act as the “agent” for all queries Q, where\\nA is usually directly acquired from the query space, i.e. A = f(Q). In contrast,\\nGRL [25] uses anchors A projected from the input X, i.e. A=Proj(X), to com-\\npute cross-scale similarity (see its Fig. 6). GPViT [55] uses learnable tokens and\\nadditional MLPs to achieve global modeling (see its Fig. 3). As a result, agent\\nattention can be applied to existing models in a training-free manner, e.g., our\\nAgentSD, which is impractical for GRL [25] and GPViT [55] since they need\\nextra training of the projections or MLPs.\\nSecondly, our perspective of generalized linear attention is unique and essen-\\ntial. This perspective enables us to unleash the potential of agent attention with\\nlightweight linear attention enhancements like DWC. In contrast, without such a\\nview, GPViT [55] and GRL [25] have to compromise with other techniques, such\\nas heavy MLP, window attention, or channel attention, to achieve comparable\\nresults.\\nThirdly, agent attention is a superior alternative to Softmax attention, acting\\nas a versatile module for general purposes, while GPViT [55] and GRL [25] are\\nnot plug-in modules and are limited to specific tasks.\\nB. Composition of Agent Bias\\nAs mentioned in the main paper, to better utilize positional information, we\\npresent a carefully designed Agent Bias for our agent attention, i.e.,\\n  \\\\ label {eq :agnet_bi as} \\\\begin {split} O^{\\\\rm A}\\\\!=\\\\ &{\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(QA^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_2)\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(AK^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_1)\\\\ V, \\\\\\\\ \\\\end {split} \\n(8)\\nwhere B1 ∈Rn×N, B2 ∈RN×n are our agent biases. For parameter efficiency,\\nwe construct each agent bias using three bias components rather than directly\\nsetting B1, B2 as learnable parameters. For instance, values in B1 are derived\\nfrom column bias B1c ∈Rn×1×w, row bias B1r ∈Rn×h×1 and block bias\\nB1b ∈Rn×h0×w0, where h, w are the height and width of feature map or at-\\ntention window, while h0, w0 are predefined hyperparameters much smaller than\\nh, w. During the computation of attention weights, B1c, B1r, B1b are resized to\\nB′\\n1c, B′\\n1r, B′\\n1b ∈Rn×h×w by repeating or interpolating, and B1 = (B′\\n1c + B′\\n1r +\\nB′\\n1b).reshape(n, N) is used as the full agent bias.\\nAgent Attention\\n19\\nC. Agent Attention for Stable Diffusion\\nC.1. Adjustments\\nAs discussed in the main paper, when producing agent tokens through token\\nmerging, our agent attention can be directly applied to the Stable Diffusion\\nmodel without any extra training. However, we are unable to apply the agent\\nbias and DWC without training. As a remedy, we make two simple adjustments\\nto our agent attention. Moreover, we change our agent attention module from\\n  \\\\label {e q:agent_a t t n_mod ule} \\\\begin {split} O=&\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(QA^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_2)\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(AK^T\\\\!\\\\!+\\\\!B_1)\\\\ V+{\\\\rm DWC}(V), \\\\end {split} \\n(9)\\nto\\n  \\\\labe l  {eq: a g e nt_attn_for_sd} \\\\begin {split} O=&\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(QA^T)\\\\ {\\\\rm \\\\sigma }(AK^T)\\\\ V+kV, \\\\end {split} \\n(10)\\nwhere k is a predefined hyperparameter. On the other hand, compared to the\\noriginal softmax attention, the two softmax attention operations of agent atten-\\ntion may result in smoother feature distribution without training. In the light\\nof this, we slightly increase the scale used for the second Softmax attention, i.e.,\\nagent broadcast.\\nC.2. Experiment Details\\nTo quantitatively compare AgentSD with Stable Diffusion and ToMeSD, we\\nfollow [3] and employ Stable Diffusion v1.5 to generate 2,000 5122 images of\\nImageNet-1k [9] classes, featuring two images per class, using 50 PLMS [28]\\ndiffusion steps with a cfg scale [11] of 7.5. Subsequently, we calculate FID [21]\\nscores between these 2,000 samples and 50,000 ImageNet-1k validation examples,\\nemploying [39]. To assess speed, we calculate the average generation time of all\\n2,000 samples on a single RTX4090 GPU.\\nComplete quantitative results are presented in Tab. 9. Compared to SD and\\nToMeSD, our AgentSD not only accelerates generation and reduces memory\\nusage, but also significantly improves image generation quality.\\nC.3. Ablation\\nWe further ablate the adjustments we made when applying agent attention to\\nStable Diffusion. As evident in Tab. 10 and Tab. 11, both adjustments to agent\\nattention enhance the quality of AgentSD generation. Tab. 12 demonstrates\\nthat applying agent attention in the early stages yields substantial performance\\nenhancements.\\n20\\nHan et al.\\nTable 9: Quantitative Results of Stable Diffusion, ToMeSD and our AgentSD.

To ver-\\nify this, we select subject-driven task as an example and apply agent attention\\nto SD-based Dreambooth [38]. We experimentally find that finetuning enables\\nthe integration of the agent attention module into all diffusion generation steps,\\nreaching 2.2x acceleration in generation speed compared to the original Dream-\\nbooth without sacrificing image quality. Additionally, time and memory cost\\nduring finetuning can be reduced as well.\\nTask and baseline. The diffusion subject-driven generation task entails main-\\ntaining the appearance of a given subject while generating novel renditions of it\\nin different contexts, e.g., generating a photo of your pet dog dancing. Dream-\\nbooth [38] effectively addresses this task by finetuning a pretrained text-to-image\\ndiffusion model, binding a unique identifier with the given subject. Novel images\\nof the subject can then be synthesized with the unique identifier.\\nApplying agent attention to Dreambooth. As previously discussed, Dream-\\nbooth [38] involves an additional finetuning process. We explore two approaches\\nto applying agent attention to Dreambooth: (1) applying it only during genera-\\ntion and (2) applying it during both finetuning and generation. The first method\\nis the same as the AgentSD detailed in the main paper, where we commonly\\napply agent attention to the early 40% of generation steps, achieving around\\na 1.7x speedup (merging ratio r = 0.4). However, applying agent attention to\\nmore diffusion steps for further acceleration leads to a decrease in image details\\nand quality, as shown in Tab. 12 and the penultimate line of Fig. 8. Conversely,\\nadopting the second approach, where the agent attention module is applied to all\\nAgent Attention\\n21\\nTable 11: Ablation on scale used for the second Softmax attention.\\nScale\\nd−0.5\\nd−0.25\\nd−0.15\\nd−0.05\\nFID\\n28.86\\n28.64\\n28.42\\n28.60\\nTable 12: Ablation on how many diffusion steps to apply agent attention.\\nSteps\\nearly 20%\\nearly 40%\\nearly 60%\\nearly 80%\\nFID\\n28.58\\n28.42\\n28.83\\n29.77\\ns/img\\n1.50\\n1.42\\n1.39\\n1.34\\nsteps in both finetuning and generation, results in a 2.2x speedup in generation\\nwithout sacrificing performance. Additionally, both time and memory costs in\\nfinetuning are reduced by around 15%, enabling model finetuning with less than\\n12GB of GPU memory in approximately 7 minutes on a single RTX4090 GPU.\\nThe last row in Fig. 8 shows the results of this setting.\\nDataset and experiment details. We adopt the dataset provided by Dream-\\nbooth [38], which comprises 30 subjects of 15 different classes. It features live\\nsubjects and objects captured in various conditions, environments, and angles.\\nWe employ pretrained Stable Diffusion v1.5 and apply agent attention to all\\ndiffusion generation steps. The merging ratio r is set to 0.4, k is set to 0.075 and\\nthe scale for the second softmax attention is set to d−0.15. We finetune all models\\nfor 800 iterations with a learning rate of 1e-6, utilizing 8-bit AdamW [10] as the\\noptimizer. We follow [38] and select sks as the unique identifier for all settings.\\nNovel synthesized images are sampled using the DDIM [42] sampler with 100\\ngeneration steps on a single RTX4090 GPU.\\nVisualization and discussion. Synthesized subject-driven images are shown\\nin Fig. 8. We make two key observations: (1) Dreambooth with agent atten-\\ntion applied during finetuning and generation equals or surpasses the baseline\\nDreambooth in terms of fidelity and editability, and (2) employing agent atten-\\ntion during finetuning further enhances the fidelity and detail quality of syn-\\nthesized images, enabling us to apply agent attention to all diffusion steps for\\nmore speedup. For the first observation, the first column shows that our method\\nensures the synthesized dog’s color aligns more consistently with input images\\ncompared to the original Dreambooth and maintains comparable editability. For\\nthe second observation, comparing the last two rows of the third column reveals\\nthat applying agent attention to all diffusion steps without finetuning yields a\\nblurry image, whereas our method produces a clearer and sharper depiction of\\nthe duck toy. Additionally, in the fifth column, our method accurately generates\\nthe cat’s eyes, whereas agent attention without finetuning fails in this aspect.\\n22\\nHan et al.\\nDream-\\nbooth\\n“ photo of a sks dog \\nin a bucket ”\\nAgent \\nAttention\\nOnly \\nDuring\\nGeneration\\nAgent \\nAttention\\nDuring\\nFinetuning\\n& \\nGeneration\\n(Ours)\\n“ photo of a sks toy \\nby the river ”\\n“ photo of a sks toy \\nwith the Eiffel Tower \\nin the background ”\\nInput \\nImages\\nPrompt\\n“ photo of a sks candle \\nwith a city in the \\nbackground ”\\n“ photo of a sks cat \\nin the snow ”\\n“ photo of a sks cat \\nwearing a red hat ”\\nFig. 8: Samples generated by Dreambooth and our Agent Dreambooth with the same\\nseed. In the second-to-last line, we apply agent attention to all diffusion steps only\\nduring generation, leading to a slight decline in image quality as expected. In the last\\nrow, agent attention is incorporated into all steps in both finetuning and generation,\\nresulting in a 2.2x speedup without compromising image quality. Zoom in for best\\nview.\\nD. Dataset and Training Setup\\nD.1. ImageNet\\nTraining settings. To ensure a fair comparison, we train our agent attention\\nmodel with the same settings as the corresponding baseline model. Specifically,\\nwe employ AdamW [31] optimizer to train all our models from scratch for 300\\nepochs, using a cosine learning rate decay and 20 epochs of linear warm-up. We\\nset the initial learning rate to 1 × 10−3 for a batch size of 1024 and linearly\\nscale it w.r.t. the batch size. Following DeiT [44], we use RandAugment [8],\\nMixup [60], CutMix [59], and random erasing [61] to prevent overfitting. We\\nalso apply a weight decay of 0.05. To align with [12], we incorporate EMA [34]\\ninto the training of our Agent-CSwin models. For finetuning at larger resolutions,\\nwe follow the settings in [12,29] and finetune the models for 30 epochs.\\nD.2. COCO\\nTraining settings.

Backbones are pretrained on Im-\\nageNet dataset with AdamW, following the training configurations mentioned in\\nthe original paper. Standard data augmentations including resize, random flip\\nand normalize are applied. We set learning rate to 1e-4 and follow the 1x learn-\\ning schedule: the whole network is trained for 12 epochs and the learning rate\\nis divided by 10 at the 8th and 11th epoch respectively. For some models, we\\nutilize 3x schedule: the network is trained for 36 epochs and the learning rate is\\ndivided by 10 at the 27th and 33rd epoch. All mAP results in the main paper\\nare tested with input image size (3, 1333, 800).\\nNumbers of agent tokens. We use the ImageNet pretrained model as the\\nbackbone, which is trained with numbers of agent tokens n set to [9, 16, 49, 49] for\\nthe four stages respectively. As dense prediction tasks involve higher-resolution\\nimages than ImageNet, we appropriately increase the numbers of agent tokens to\\nbetter preserve the rich information. Specifically, for all the Agent-PVT models,\\nwe assign the numbers of agent tokens for the four stages as [144, 256, 784, 784],\\nwhile for all Agent-Swin models, we allocate [81, 144, 196, 49]. We employ bilinear\\ninterpolation to adapt the agent bias to the increased numbers of agent tokens\\nn. The same strategy is applied to ADE20k experiments as well.\\nD.3. ADE20K\\nTraining settings. ADE20K [62] is a well-established benchmark for semantic\\nsegmentation which encompasses 20K training images and 2K validation images.\\nBackbones are pretrained on ImageNet with AdamW, following the training\\nconfigurations mentioned in the original paper. For UperNet [51], we use AdamW\\nto optimize, and set the initial learning rate as 6e-5 with a linear warmup of\\n1,500 iterations. Models are trained for 160K iterations in total. For Semantic\\nFPN [23], we optimize the models using AdamW for 40k iterations with an initial\\nlearning rate of 2e-4. We randomly resize and crop the image to 512 × 512 for\\ntraining, and re-scale to have a shorter side of 512 pixels during testing.\\nE. Complete Experimental Results\\nFull classification results.
